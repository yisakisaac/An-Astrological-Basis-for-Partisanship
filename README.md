The Chi squared test of the relationship between zodiac signs and marital status gives a chi squared value of 49.69 with a p value of 0.3 which allows us to accept the null hypothesis due to such a high p value. Also when looking at the cross tabulations with gender controlled there is still no relationship seen between zodiac signs and marital status because data has an even distribution among the variables with very little fluctuations.
